Hi, I'mÂ **SebastiÃ¡n ZÃºÃ±iga**,Â **[UI/UX Frontend designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dactrtr/)**Â andÂ **[Illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/dactrtr.svg/)**, always looking for the new "tech kid on the block", researching to improve my work, or developing (I also like to **[code](https://github.com/dactrtr)**) new skills. I'm the serious looking funny guy at every place and the designer that is in the middle of the developers talking like one more of the pack.

**Hey!**Â wait, all that knowledge research isÂ **useless if isn't shared**, that's why with one of myÂ **[friends](http://www.arielcerda.com/)**Â we run a small group ofÂ **[Sketch](https://medium.com/sketchchile)**Â where we share tutorials and stuff so cool that sometimes ~~seems to beÂ **frozen**~~ it's actually frozen in time.

Actually based in **Japan**Â ~~South Korea~~ ~~Portugal~~ ~~Austria~~ ~~Romania~~ ~~Bulgaria~~ ~~France~~ ~~Tukye~~ ~~Sri Lanka~~ ~~Chile~~ , working remotely forÂ **Myself**

Learning SwiftUI and LUA.
